Project 1 - Impact of COVID-19 on the Stock Market and the Healthcare Industry



By: Erjola Lluka, Gayatri John, Vincent Pham


Project Description

Analyzing the impact of COVID-19 on stock market returns and taking a deep-dive into the healthcare sector.



Installing and Running the Project

- There is no need as the code is simply used to verify our analysis. But uploaded for transparency.



What was our motivation?

 - We all thought the healthcare industry would outperform the market during the COVID-19 crisis but of course we must look at the data to verify what we thought to be true.
 
What did we learn?

- We found that COVID-19 had a negative impact on the market as a whole and on the healthcare sector as well. We also found that there was no difference in the impact of COVID-19 on the healthcare sector compared to the rest of the market.

- Our findings showed that healthcare sector did not outperform the market after COVID-19, contrary to what many people believed. 

- Market cap size is impactful on stock returns, with different market cap size categories experiencing different returns and risk (standard deviation). 

- We used SPY and IYH as benchmarks for the market and healthcare sector respectively, and found that both prices and returns move quite similarly.

References

- We obtained our data from csv files pulled from stockmarketmba.com for healthcare stocks.

- We used https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_S%26P_500_companies#S&P_500_component_stocks for a list of S&P500 companies

- Stock data from that list of S&P500 companies were pulled from the yahoo_fin.stock_info python library.
