Hypothesis:

Q1: Did healthcare companies perform better in the 'post-covid' period? (compared to before covid)

Alternative Hypothesis: µ(returns of healthcare precovid) ≠ µ(returns of healthcare post covid)

Null Hypothesis: µ(returns of healthcare precovid) = µ(returns of healthcare post covid)

----

Q2: Did market perform better in the 'post-covid' period? (compared to before covid)

HA (alternative hypothesis): µ(returns of market precovid) ≠ µ(returns of market post covid)

H0 (null hypothesis): µ(returns of market precovid) = µ(returns of market post covid)


---

Q3: is the difference in performance healthcare experienced significantly different than the market (diff-in-diff t-test)

Why and how we decided to choose this topic


---

descriptive/summary statistics: (do it for entire dataset, 
then seperate for respective market caps (healthcare), 
then one for just all healthcare,

one for just s&p
then one for large cap s&p,
then one for mid cap s&p,
one for low cap s&p)

mean
median
mode
variance
std dev

trend analysis

potential correlation analysis
    - as in with maybe correlation between the number of cases in the pandemic vs performance of healthcare stocks?
    - and number of cases in the pandemic vs the market

linear regression?

hypothesis testing
comparitive analysis

---


Visualizations and relationships to make and look at:

comparisons between small, mid, large cap stocks
comparisons between the respective market caps and s&P500
comparisons between all healthcare stocks and s&P500
comparisons between outliers and the rest of the healthcare sector
comparisons between outliers and the s&P500
comparisons between outliers and the rest of the healthcare stocks in its respective market cap

trend analysis pre and during (potentially using moving averages)



---

2 sample t-tests (randomizing 500 healthcare stocks multiple times? probably 3 times)
    market vs healthcare
    healthcare pre and post covid



---

Some questions that we have (so far, and to add more):

Which healthcare stocks performed best before and during COVID-19?

Did healthcare stocks generally outperform the S&P500 during COVID-19?

How quickly did healthcare stocks recover after COVID-19 compared to the S&P500?

What variables may affect its performance?:

    Does the market cap play a role?

    What about average volume

Low, mid, large - comparisons (before, during)
    all versions and variations

What are the outliers?

How do they compare to the S&P500
    comparison with their respective market cap?
